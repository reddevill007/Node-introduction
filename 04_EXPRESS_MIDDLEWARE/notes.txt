user -> (if something went wrong response is returned directle to user) middleware -> function (app.get) - res -> user

Middleware is a function that runs every req, res

Single code can have multiple middleware

Defination ==> these are functions that have access to the req and res object and the next 
               middleware function in the application req-res cycle


Middleware function can perform the following tasks:

-> Execute the code
-> Make changes to req and res objects
-> End the req-res cycle
-> Call the next middleware function in the stack


Example:

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log("Hello from middleware 1");
    next();
})
