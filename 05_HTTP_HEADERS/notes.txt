HTTP Headers are an important part of API req and res as they represent the meta-data associated with the API req and res.

Headers carry information for the req and res body.

Example:
{       
  ':scheme': 'http',
  ':authority': 'localhost:8000',
  ':path': '/',
  ':method': 'GET'
}

** Always add X to custom headers ** -> Good Practice
